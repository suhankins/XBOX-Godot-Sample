# PlayFab GDExtension Spec

## Overview

This document defines the current design direction for the `godot_playfab` addon.

`godot_playfab` owns PlayFab runtime bootstrap, manual PlayFab sign-in keyed by local Xbox user id, Game Saves flows, and leaderboard flows built on top of the PlayFab C SDKs. The public API is intentionally GDScript-first: a single `PlayFab` root singleton, `RefCounted` wrapper types, and `await`-friendly async operation objects.

## Design goals

1. **Single root singleton** — expose one `PlayFab` entry point instead of multiple global singletons.
2. **Manual sign-in** — PlayFab sign-in is an explicit gameplay action, even though the addon can resolve local Xbox users through `XUser`.
3. **Project-settings-backed config** — runtime configuration comes from `playfab/titleid` and `playfab/endpoint`.
4. **Godot-native async flow** — all one-shot requests return `PlayFabAsyncOp` and complete with `PlayFabResult`.
5. **Typed Game Saves and leaderboard calls** — higher-level services require an already-signed-in `PlayFabUser`.
6. **Idempotent loading** — multiple synced `.gdextension` files pointing at the same DLL must not duplicate class or singleton registration.

## Scope

| Domain | Included | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Runtime init/shutdown | Yes | `XGameRuntimeInitialize`, PlayFab init, shared queue |
| Manual sign-in | Yes | local-id / `GDKUser`-based entry points |
| Cached user sessions | Yes | `PlayFabUser` keyed by local Xbox user id |
| Game Saves | Yes | add/sync, upload, folder/quota/cloud-state queries |
| Leaderboards | Yes | submit, global, around-user, friends/social |
| Multiplayer / Party | No | legacy code exists, but it is out of scope for the new root API |

## Public API summary

### Root singleton

- `PlayFab`

### Wrapper types

| Native concept | GDScript wrapper |
| --- | --- |
| one-shot async request | `PlayFabAsyncOp` |
| HRESULT + payload | `PlayFabResult` |
| local-user PlayFab session | `PlayFabUser` |

### Service surfaces

- `PlayFab.users`
- `PlayFab.game_saves`
- `PlayFab.leaderboards`

## Runtime configuration

The runtime reads these Project Settings keys:

- `playfab/titleid`
- `playfab/endpoint`
- `playfab/runtime/embed_dispatch`

The endpoint setting is optional. When blank, the runtime derives the default endpoint from the title id.

## Async model

The addon uses one shared task queue owned by the PlayFab runtime. Native completion stays inside the extension until it is converted into Godot-friendly state and emitted through signals or completed async ops.

Rules:

1. One-shot public APIs return `PlayFabAsyncOp`.
2. Completion data is delivered through `PlayFabResult`.
3. `PlayFabResult.data` uses Godot-native types (`Dictionary`, `Array`, `String`, `int`, etc.).
4. With `playfab/runtime/embed_dispatch = true`, the addon pumps completions automatically each process frame.
5. When embed dispatch is disabled, callers must pump the queue manually with `PlayFab.dispatch()`.

## User/session model

`PlayFabUser` represents one signed-in PlayFab session associated with a local Xbox user id.

Publicly exposed data is intentionally narrow:

- `local_id`
- `entity_key`

Xbox-facing identity details do not belong on the PlayFab user wrapper. The wrapper only exposes what higher-level PlayFab systems need.

## Game Saves

Game Saves methods require a signed-in `PlayFabUser`. The runtime initializes `PFGameSaveFiles` alongside the rest of the PlayFab bootstrap, and the signed-in user wrapper retains the internal `PFLocalUserHandle` needed by the Game Saves APIs.

Supported calls:

- `add_user_with_ui_async(user, options := PlayFabGameSaves.ADD_USER_OPTION_NONE)`
- `upload_with_ui_async(user, release_device_as_active := false)`
- `set_save_description_async(user, short_save_description)`
- `reset_cloud_async(user)`
- `get_folder(user)`
- `get_folder_size(user)`
- `get_remaining_quota(user)`
- `is_connected_to_cloud(user)`

The add-user wrapper returns a snapshot dictionary containing the synced folder path, folder size, cloud-connection state, local id, and entity key. When the user is connected to the cloud, the result also includes the remaining quota in bytes.

## Leaderboards

Leaderboard methods require a signed-in `PlayFabUser` and do not accept a raw local id or arbitrary variant.

Supported calls:

- `submit_score_async(user, leaderboard_name, score, additional_scores := [], metadata := "")`
- `get_leaderboard_async(user, leaderboard_name, start_position := 1, page_size := 10, version := -1)`
- `get_leaderboard_around_user_async(user, leaderboard_name, max_surrounding_entries := 10, version := -1)`
- `get_friend_leaderboard_async(user, leaderboard_name, include_xbox_friends := true, version := -1)`

## Samples

- `sample\playfab_demo` demonstrates settings-backed init plus manual PlayFab sign-in
