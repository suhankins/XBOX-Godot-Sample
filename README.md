# GodotGDK

A repository of Godot 4.x GDExtension addons for the Microsoft public GDK
(Game Development Kit).

## Addons

| Addon | Description | Status |
|-------|-------------|--------|
| [`godot_gdk`](addons/godot_gdk/) | GDK runtime, Xbox user identity, Xbox achievements, Xbox presence, Xbox social graph, Xbox multiplayer activity | Runtime/users/achievements/presence/social/multiplayer-activity baseline |
| [`godot_gameinput`](addons/godot_gameinput/) | Native GameInput controller support | Scaffold (build pipeline verified) |
| [`godot_gdk_packaging`](addons/godot_gdk_packaging/) | GDScript editor plugin for PC MSIXVC packaging via `makepkg.exe` | Editor plugin (no C++ build) |

## Quick start

```powershell
# Clone with submodules
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/gaming-microsoft/godot-public-gdk-ext.git
cd godot-public-gdk-ext

# Build
cmake --preset default
cmake --build build --preset debug

# Launch the sample
.\sample\gdk_demo\launch_editor.bat
```

> **Note:** Building and opening the sample works immediately. Xbox Live
> features require Partner Center setup —
> see [Sample Project Setup](docs/godot-gdk-sample-setup.md).

The repo also includes a ShamWow-inspired scenario shell sample at
`sample\shamwow\`. Launch it with:

```powershell
.\sample\shamwow\launch_editor.bat
```

### Requirements

- Windows 10 (18362+) or Windows 11
- [Microsoft GDK](https://github.com/microsoft/GDK/releases)
  (`winget install Microsoft.Gaming.GDK`)
- [Godot 4.3+](https://godotengine.org/download)
- Visual Studio 2022+ with the C++ Desktop workload
- CMake 3.20+

- `sample\shamwow\` — scenario-driven shell inspired by ShamWow, built around grouped runtime/users/achievements/multiplayer-activity actions and an event log
- `sample\multiplayer_pong\` — multiplayer pong with Xbox identity and single player mode

## Usage

1. Copy `addons/godot_gdk/` into your Godot project
2. Enable the addon in Project → Project Settings → Plugins
3. Use from GDScript:

```gdscript
func _ready():
    GDK.initialize()

func _process(_delta):
    GDK.dispatch()

func _exit_tree():
    GDK.shutdown()
```

See the [API Reference](docs/godot-gdk-api-reference.md) for the full surface.

## GDK Packaging Addon

The `godot_gdk_packaging` addon is a pure GDScript editor plugin (no C++ build required) that
wraps Microsoft GDK PC packaging tools into the Godot Editor.

### Features

- **GDK Packaging toolbar menu** with quick access to all tools and documentation
- **MSIXVC Package Creation** — configure makepkg flags and create PC packages from the editor
- **Mapping File Generation** — auto-generate layout.xml via `makepkg genmap`
- **Package Validation** — dry-run validation before building
- **MicrosoftGame.config Management** — create templates, parse identity, launch GameConfigEditor
- **Documentation Links** — direct links to MS Learn docs for PC packaging, makepkg, and GameConfigEditor

### Setup

1. Copy `addons/godot_gdk_packaging/` into your Godot project's `addons/` folder
2. In the Godot Editor, go to **Project → Project Settings → Plugins** and enable **GDK Packaging**
3. The GDK tools are discovered automatically from `C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft GDK\bin\`
   (override with the `GDK_BIN` environment variable if needed)

### Usage

- Use the **GDK Packaging** dropdown menu in the editor toolbar for quick actions
- The **GDK Packaging** dock panel (bottom-right) provides the full packaging UI:
  1. Set your content directory (exported Godot project files)
  2. Configure packaging options (encryption, update compatibility, etc.)
  3. Click **Create Package** to build an MSIXVC package

## Testing Achievements

Achievements must be configured in [Partner Center](https://partner.microsoft.com/) and published
to your development sandbox before they can be unlocked.

To **reset** achievements for re-testing, use the included helper script:

```powershell
.\tools\reset_player_data.ps1
```

This signs into Partner Center via `XblDevAccount.exe`, then calls `XblPlayerDataReset.exe`
to wipe achievements, stats, and leaderboards for the specified test account. You'll need:

- **Service Config ID (SCID)** — from Partner Center → Xbox Live → Xbox Live Setup
- **Sandbox ID** — the development sandbox your test account is signed into
- **XUID** — the Xbox User ID of the test account to reset

> **Note:** Resets only work on Xbox test accounts in a development sandbox, not retail accounts.
> Restart the game after resetting for changes to take effect.
