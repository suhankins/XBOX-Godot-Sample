# GodotGDK Documentation

Welcome to the documentation for the GodotGDK repository — a collection of
Godot 4.x GDExtension addons for Windows gaming integrations around the
Microsoft public GDK.

## Getting started

- [**Getting Started**](getting-started.md) — prerequisites, building,
  VS Code setup, and development workflow

## Sample projects

Three sample projects live under `sample/`:

| Sample | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| [`gdk_demo`](godot-gdk-sample-and-tests.md) | GDK addon demo + headless test suite |
| [`shamwow`](godot-gdk-sample-and-tests.md) | ShamWow-inspired scenario shell |
| `multiplayer_pong` | Multiplayer pong with Xbox identity and single player AI |

All samples share the same GDK setup. See [Sample Project Setup](godot-gdk-sample-setup.md)
for Partner Center configuration.

## GameInput addon (`godot_gameinput`)

- [**GameInput Addon**](godot-gameinput.md) — current status, planned API, and
  build instructions

## Design specs

Design intent documents live in [`spec/`](../spec/). These describe the planned
API surface and are not guaranteed to match the current implementation.

- [`gdext-gdk.md`](../spec/gdext-gdk.md) — GDK addon design spec
- [`gdext-gameinput.md`](../spec/gdext-gameinput.md) — GameInput addon design spec
